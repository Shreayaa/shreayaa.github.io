        <p>
          It's the beginning of a new semester at college. You're juggling classes, clubs, assignments, and the million things happening on campus. But in the middle of all that chaos, something feels off.
        </p>
        <p>
          Maybe the traditional dance you used to practice every week is now a once-a-semester thing. Maybe it's that you haven't cooked the recipes you grew up with in months. Or maybe it's simply the quiet ache of not hearing your language spoken outside your phone calls home.
        </p>
        <p>
          For students from culturally diverse backgrounds, hobbies aren't just ways to pass time. They are a way of remembering who you are while building who you're becoming. And yet, we found that these practices are the first to be sacrificed in the grind of university life.
        </p>
        <p>
          That disconnect is what inspired <strong>Routes to Roots</strong>: a project to understand the barriers to cultural hobby engagement and design a solution that helps students reconnect, reflect, and sustain their cultural practices.

        <p>To explore these, we followed these sprints:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Interviewed and observed students who practiced cultural hobbies.</li>
          <li>As the first method, we used cultural probes and diary studies to capture lived experiences.</li>
          <li>As the second method, we conducted an autoethnography, where we became participants ourselves.</li>
          <li>Analyzed the data we collected in the methods through affinity mapping, personas, word clouds, and graphs.</li>
          <li>Prototyped and wireframed the kiosk-based solution.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Method 1: Cultural Probes & Diaries</h4>
        <p>
          We recruited 10 students from cultural clubs across Cornell. Their hobbies ranged from cultural dance to cooking, calligraphy, and music.
        </p>
        <p>Each student received a cultural-probe kit with four parts:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A diary study with daily questions about cultural connections and hobby engagement.</li>
          <li>
            A handmade scrapbook wherein the participants had to:
            <ul>
              <li>Draw pictures/drawings about how they perceive their cultural hobbies</li>
              <li>Fill out an index card documenting feelings about what they miss</li>
              <li>Keep a timeline map tracking hobby journeys to mark peaks and lows</li>
              <li>Place themselves in a "Community-Web" diagram where they map their connections to different communities</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>A weekly schedule grid recording time spent on academic commitments, required extracurricular commitments, leisurely hobbies, and cultural activities.</li>
          <li>A postcard to future self</li>
        </ul>

          <img src={item4} alt="Letter to future self about cultural hobby goals" />
        </div>

        <h5>What we found</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>One participant wrote about cooking as "the only way I feel at home again," while another described the pride of explaining her culture to friends through film.</li>
          <li>Most cultural hobbies occupied just 0–3 hours a week, often disappearing during busy academic stretches. One participant simply wrote, "No time. Makes me sad."</li>
          <li>Postcards revealed a longing to stay connected. "Don't let work wash away your passion," one wrote to their future self.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We created a persona to guide us.</p>

        <img src={persona} alt="Maya Chen persona - showing user goals, pain points, and expectations for cultural hobby engagement" />

        <h4>Method 2: Autoethnography</h4>
        <p>
          As a team, we resonated with much of the problem statement, and what we found with method 1 we decided to turn inward. We each chose a hobby-related app (from music practice trackers to cooking platforms) and used them daily for a week while journaling our experiences.
        </p>
        <h5>What we noticed</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Writing about a cooking app, one teammate noted that the joy came not from the interface, but from memories with their cousins back home.</li>
          <li>Apps lacked built-in motivators: No streaks, reminders, or emotional check-ins meant enthusiasm faded quickly.</li>
          <li>We wanted to track how hobbies made us feel, not just how many minutes we logged.</li>
          <li>We felt tone mattered. Apps that offered storytelling or cultural context resonated far more than mechanical, checklist-style ones.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This exercise made one thing clear: digital apps alone wouldn't cut it. Students needed cultural engagement to be easily available and emotionally resonant.

        <p>
          We decided against building "just another app." Instead, we created a kiosk-based system, a visible, physical presence on campus in common spaces.
        </p>
        <p>
          Why a kiosk? Because visibility itself is part of the intervention. By embedding cultural expression into shared spaces, we aimed to normalize it, celebrate it, and make it discoverable.
        </p>
        <h5>Key Features</h5>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Explore:</strong> Students tap their ID and browse cultural hobbies, peer groups, events, and practice spaces.</li>
          <li><strong>Contribute:</strong> They can add their own cultural practices, keeping the system alive and inclusive.</li>
          <li><strong>Connect:</strong> After each interaction, students receive a curated follow-up email with event links, peer contacts, or reflection prompts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Instead of productivity dashboards, the kiosk offers gentle reminders that say: "Your roots matter."

          <li>Using both cultural probes and autoethnography taught me the strength of combining generative and reflective research.</li>
          <li>This project and this course as a whole taught me that sometimes the right design intervention isn't another digital app. Considering the physical context of campus life helped us create a more visible and impactful solution.</li>
